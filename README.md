Project Date: April, 2019

This project basically designed which people those are physically disabled. Most of the case the disable people face some problem 
like they want to clean their environment, but they're not enabled to do that because of their physical issue.  This project helps 
them to clean their environment and this automated dustbin controlled by Android can much easy their everyday life. We are presently 
living in the 21st century. Presently, the advanced mobile phone has transformed into the most fundamental thing in our regular daily 
existence. Android application-based smartphone is transforming into each time even more predominant and outfitted with a couple of 
embellishments that are useful for Robots. This project portrays how to control an automated smart dustbin using mobile through Bluetooth 
communication, some features about Bluetooth technology, components of the mobile and robot. We determined basic answers of a structure 
to building automated smart dustbin with very low cost but with high computation and detecting capacities given by the smartphone 
that isutilized as a control device.
